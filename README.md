# Encode-and-Decode
**DESCRIPTION**

Using this python script, we can encode and decode the text to different kind of formats like complex encryption techniques like AES, Single DES and few basic encryptions like Base64, Base32, Rot13. Many more encryption techniques are going to be added to the script.

**USAGE**

Usage of the tool is very simple. Just follow the following steps one by one.
```
git clone https://TridevReddy/Encode-and-Decode.git
cd Encode-and-Decode
python3 -r requirements.txt
python3 EncodeDecode.py
```

**For Encoding:**

For Encoding the data, follow the below syntax.
```
python3 EncodeDecode.py -m encode -t "Text To Be Encoded"
```

**For Decoding:**

For Decoding the data, follow the below syntax.
